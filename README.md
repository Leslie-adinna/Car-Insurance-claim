# Car Insurance Claim Prediction

## Project Overview

AutoInland, a vehicle insurance provider, interacts with customers at very few touchpoints. Among these, filing and settling claims is one of the most critical. To maintain high customer satisfaction and improve service levels, AutoInland aims to anticipate future demands by predicting claim request volumes.

This project focuses on building a predictive model that determines whether a customer will submit a car insurance claim in the next **three months**. By forecasting potential claims, AutoInland can optimize financial planning and resource allocation, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.

## Objective

**Goal:** Develop a machine learning model that predicts if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim.
**Target Variable:** *Outcome* (1 = Customer submitted a claim, 0 = No claim).
**Business Value:**

  * Streamline financial planning
  * Improve claims handling
  * Enhance customer service by anticipating needs

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   * Understand class distribution of the target variable.

2. **EDA**

   * Visualize relationships between features and claim outcomes.
   * Identify trends, outliers, and correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Encode categorical variables.
   * Scale/normalize continuous features.
   * Engineer new features (e.g., age bins, vehicle categories).

4. **Modeling**

   * Experiment with multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
   * Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Compare models using performance metrics.
   * Select the best-performing model based on domain-relevant metrics.

6. **Interpretation & Visualization**

   * Present confusion matrix heatmap.
   * Explain trade-offs (Precision vs Recall).
   * Highlight business implications of predictions.

## Expected Outcomes

* A predictive model that identifies customers likely to file a claim.
* Insights into customer behavior and claim patterns.
* A framework for AutoInland to anticipate claim volumes, allocate resources efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Tools:**

  * Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
  * Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * Modeling: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest
  * Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

---

## Notes

* The outcome variable is binary (1 = Claim submitted, 0 = No claim).
* Model focus should balance **recall** (catching actual claimants) and **specificity** (avoiding false alarms).
